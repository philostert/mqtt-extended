Welcome to mqtt-broker's Project Documentation
##############################################

This project was originally developed **Tegris Ltda** for the FieldLink_
application and is distributed under the conditions described in the
:doc:`licensing chapter </licensing>`.

The actual project tends to complete its functionalities to prove the concept
of fog computing applied to MQTT, that is: pre-treating the data before it 
reaches the cloud.

The documentation stands to help client implementations use the broker
and thus further develop their implementation. However, until the latest
milestone of the ::doc`roadmap </roadmap>`

You may contact the Tegris project maintainer by dropping a message at

`issue tracker`_.
